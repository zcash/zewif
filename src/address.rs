/// A high-level address representation with metadata in a Zcash wallet.
///
/// `Address` serves as the primary container for all Zcash addresses, wrapping
/// the protocol-specific address details with additional wallet-level metadata
/// such as a user-assigned name, purpose descriptor, and arbitrary attachments.
/// This structure bridges the raw cryptographic address formats with the
/// user-facing wallet experience.
///
/// # Zcash Concept Relation
/// In Zcash wallets, users typically assign labels or metadata to their addresses
/// for easier identification. `Address` preserves these user-defined attributes
/// alongside the underlying cryptographic address details. It supports all Zcash
/// address protocols:
///
/// - **Transparent addresses**: Bitcoin-compatible addresses (t-prefixed)
/// - **Sapling addresses**: Shielded Sapling protocol addresses (z-prefixed)
/// - **Unified addresses**: Multi-protocol addresses (u-prefixed)
///
/// # Data Preservation
/// During wallet migration, the following components are preserved:
///
/// - **Address Data**: The complete protocol-specific address details
/// - **User Labels**: Custom names assigned to addresses by users
/// - **Purpose Strings**: Descriptions of the address's intended use
/// - **Attachments**: Any additional metadata associated with the address
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// # use zewif::{Address, ProtocolAddress, transparent};
/// #
/// // Create a transparent address
/// let t_addr = transparent::Address::new("t1exampleaddress");
/// let protocol_addr = ProtocolAddress::Transparent(t_addr);
///
/// // Wrap it in an Address with metadata
/// let mut address = Address::new(protocol_addr);
/// address.set_name("Donation Address".to_string());
/// address.set_purpose("Receiving public donations".to_string());
///
/// // Access the address string
/// assert!(address.as_string().starts_with("t1"));
/// assert_eq!(address.name(), "Donation Address");
/// ```
